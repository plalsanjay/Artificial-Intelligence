This assignment involves enabling the Pacman agent to act appropriately in the game where there are ghosts in the world. The Pacman still aims at eating all the dots but must plan its action taking the behaviour of the ghosts into account. This exercise will involve modeling the decision-making task as an adversarial search problem that allows the Pacman to decide actions while taking into account the behaviour of ghosts. Designed and implemented a Reflex Agent with evaluation function for states which state to choose who aims at eating food and avoiding ghost based on the current situation of world. Designed and implemented minimax, alpha-beta pruning and expectimax algorithm which goes in future states and determines which is the best optimal move for the agent to take for eating food and avoiding ghost and scored 23.91/25 in the assignment more than the class average which was 21.52/25 in which competitive grading was given.
